# 📊 Sales Data Dashboard 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analyst Internship – Task 8**.
The objective was to design a **simple, interactive dashboard** to analyze sales performance by **Region, Category, and Month-Year** using Tableau.



## 🛠 Tools & Dataset

* **Tool Used:** Tableau

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Regional Sales:** The **West region** generated the highest sales and profit, while the **Central region** showed weaker performance.
2. **Category Contribution:** **Technology and Office Supplies** contributed the most to sales, whereas **Furniture lagged** behind.
3. **Profitability Analysis:** Certain **Furniture sub-categories (Tables, Bookcases)** recorded **losses despite sales**, highlighting the need for margin improvement.


## ✅ Outcome

This task helped me learn how to:

* Build **interactive Tableau dashboards**
